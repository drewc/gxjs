 *Gerbil Loader: Use ~gxc~ and ~gsc~ load Gerbil to JavaScript*

The ~gerbil-loader~ package makes it easy to load a gerbil file into a
JavaScript runtime.

The ~gerbil-scheme~ package is based off of [[https://cons.io/][Gerbil]], a scheme written in itself
that compiles to [[http://gambitscheme.org/][Gambit Scheme]].

The ~gerbil-scheme~ UMD library allows many different uses of that runtime and will at some point allow loading of gerbil modules.

* Installation

Easy! I choose ~yarn~, but ~npm~ also works.

#+begin_src shell
yarn add gerbil-loader --dev
yarn add gerbil-scheme
#+end_src
