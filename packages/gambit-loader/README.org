*Gambit Loader : Use ~gsc~ for Scheme -> JavaScript*

The Gambit programming system is a full implementation of the Scheme language
which conforms to the R4RS, R5RS and IEEE Scheme standards.

The ~gambit-loader~ package allows the loading of a scheme file in a javascript
environment.

The ~gambit-scheme~ UMD library is one way to have a runtime that works
alongside it.

* Installation

Easy! I choose ~yarn~, but ~npm~ also works.

#+begin_src shell
yarn add gambit-loader --dev
yarn add gambit-scheme
#+end_src
