#+TITLE: Gambit Scheme : Universal Runtime for Scheme
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil


*Gambit Scheme*

The Gambit programming system is a full implementation of the Scheme language
which conforms to the R4RS, R5RS and IEEE Scheme standards.

The ~gambit-scheme~ UMD library allows many different uses of that runtime.

* Installation

Easy! I choose ~yarn~, but ~npm~ also works.

#+begin_src shell
yarn add gambit-scheme
#+end_src

One probably wants to load ~.scm~ files. For that ~gambit-loader~ is one option.

#+begin_src shell
yarn add gambit-loader --dev
#+end_src
