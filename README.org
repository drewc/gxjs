#+TITLE: GxJs: A runtime for Scheme, in JavaScript

"One lang to rule them all and in parens let bind them."

* Introduction

I tend to forget the differing syntax and semantics amoung the billions[fn:1] of
programming languages I need to read or write overy month.

Sometimes a meta-layer on top is just the thing I find very sexp.

* Features

 - Most of ~R7RS~
 - *Gerbil*'s ~def~
 - Small minimized runtime and lazy-loading of larger ~(features)~


* Footnotes

[fn:1] Ok, likely under 15 or so. But still!
