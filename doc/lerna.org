#+TITLE: Lerna: A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages


* Intro

*GxJS* has very much been about learning how the *JavaScript* community works.
It seems components are divided up into packages. Those packages are described
by a ~package.json~ file.

That file is uploaded and the package published to the *npm registry*. That way
it can be used trivially by other packages, in my case mostly as modules.

However, it does seem the default is to have a single *git* repo for every
package. That seems like a headache. As I was investigating that direction I
discovered *Lerna*.

Here are some useful docs.
