#+TITLE: Make It Smaller
#+DATE: <2020-12-27 Sun>

As of right now, <2020-12-27 Sun>, the runtime is, well, small to me yet huge to
webpack and friends.

#+begin_src shell
$ du gxjs.js
4420    gxjs.js

$ yarn run webpack

* Prim(a|i)tes and natural selection

   - [X] Vectors :: Cutting out the default vector files takes almost 1mb off
     the ~du~. Lets try our own JS versions. See [[file:~/me/src/gxjs/doc/primitive.org::#primVec][Vectors]] in primitive.org

     1) full vectors
         : 4420    gxjs.js
     2) No vectors?
         : 3612    gxjs.js
     3) My new JS vectors and bytevectors
         : 3648    gxjs.js
         : (2.59 MiB) for main.js

         Almost 1/2 mb!
